'@backstage/create-app': patch
---

Tweaked template to provide an example and guidance for how to configure sign-in in `packages/backend/src/plugins/auth.ts`. There is no need to add this to existing apps, but for more information about sign-in configuration, see https://backstage.io/docs/auth/identity-resolver.
